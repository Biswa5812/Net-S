## Interpreting PING:

>Packet Internet Groper, commonly abbreviated as PING, is a diagnostic tool that tests connectivity between two nodes or devices across a network. PING verifies whether or not a network data packet is capable of being distributed to an address without having errors.

>The following are considered as a good ping response time:
  - 30 ms â€“ excellent ping and ideal for online gaming.
  - 30 to 50 ms â€“ average ping and still good for online gaming.
  - 50 to 100 ms â€“ somewhat slow ping time and this affects online gaming.
  - 100 to 500 ms â€“ slow ping and only has minimal effect on web browsing but creates a noticeable lag in online gaming.
  - 500 ms â€“ pings of a half second or more will add a noticeable delay to all requests.
